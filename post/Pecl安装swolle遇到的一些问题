1.开启openssl时提示not found!

Apple has deprecated use of OpenSSL in favor of its own TLS and crypto libraries

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

当前解决思路为:
1.brew install OpenSSL
2.导入环境变量
LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include

另外貌似也可以使用brew install libgcrypt
